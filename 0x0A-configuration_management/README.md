# Configuration Management Project

## Overview

This project focuses on configuration management, DevOps practices, SysAdmin tasks, scripting, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Puppet. 

## Background Context

The inspiration for this project comes from a past experience working on an auto-remediation tool, Skynet, during employment at SlideShare. An incident involving a bug in the code resulted in unintended consequences, highlighting the importance of configuration management. Puppet played a crucial role in restoring the infrastructure efficiently.
