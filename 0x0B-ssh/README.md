## Background Context

This project involves working with SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to a remote server using an RSA key pair instead of a password. The project aims to enhance your understanding of servers, SSH, and key authentication. You will configure your local SSH client and connect to a remote Ubuntu server using specific guidelines.

## Resources

Before starting the tasks, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [What is a (physical) server - text](https://example.com)
- [What is a (physical) server - video](https://example.com)
- [SSH essentials](https://example.com)
- [SSH Config File](https://example.com)
- [Public Key Authentication for SSH](https://example.com)
- [How Secure Shell Works](https://example.com)
- [SSH Crash Course](https://example.com) (Long, but highly informative. Watch this if configuring SSH is still confusing. It may be helpful to watch at x1.25 speed or above.)
- [Understanding the SSH Encryption and Connection Process](https://example.com)
- [Secure Shell Wiki](https://example.com)
- [IETF RFC 4251 (Description of the SSH Protocol)](https://example.com)
- [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://example.com)
- `man` or `help`:
  - `ssh`
  - `ssh-keygen`
  - `env`

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain:

- General
  - What is a server
  - Where servers usually live
  - What is SSH
  - How to create an SSH RSA key pair
  - How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
  - The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are responsible for creating solutions for the tasks on your own. Copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work, as well as publishing the content of this project, is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

- **General:**
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  - All files should end with a new line
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the folder is mandatory
  - All Bash script files must be executable
  - The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
  - The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose
- **Your servers:**
  - Server information available in the intranet's "my servers" section
  - Server configured with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Tasks

### 0. Use a private key

**File:** `0-use_a_private_key`

Write a Bash script that uses SSH to connect to your server using the private key `~/.ssh/school` with the user `ubuntu`.

**Requirements:**

- Use only single-character flags for SSH
- Do not use `-l`
- No need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase

Example:

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-use_a_private_key
ubuntu@server01:~$ exit
Connection to 8.8.8.8 closed.
sylvain@ubuntu$
```

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-system_engineering-devops`
- Directory: `0x0B-ssh`
- File: `0-use_a_private_key`

### 1. Create an SSH key pair

**File:** `1-create_ssh_key_pair`

Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

**Requirements:**

- Name of the created private key must be `school`
- Number of bits in the created key to be created: `4096`
- The created key must be protected by the passphrase `betty`

Example:

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ls
1-create_ssh_key_pair
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-create_ssh_key_pair
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in school.
Your public key has been saved in school.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
5d:a8:c1:f5:98:b6:e5:c0:9b:ee:02:c4:d4:01:f3:ba vagrant@ubuntu
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 4096]----+
|      oo...      |
|      .+.o =     |
|     o  + B +    |
|      o. = O     |
|     .. S = .    |
|      .. .       |
|      E.  .      |
|        ..       |
|         ..      |
+-----------------+
sylvain@ubuntu$ ls
1-create_ssh_key_pair school  school.pub
sylvain@ubuntu$
```

- GitHub repository: `alx-system_engineering-devops`
- Directory: `0x0B-ssh`
- File: `1-create_ssh_key_pair`

### 2. Client configuration file

**File:** `2-ssh_config`

Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client. Configure it to use the private key `~/.ssh/school` and refuse to authenticate using a password.

Example:

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh -v ubuntu@98.98.98.98
OpenSSH_6.6.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 47: Applying options for *
debug1: Connecting to 98.98.98.98 port 22.
...
Authenticated to 98.98.98.98 ([98.98.98.98]:22).
...
ubuntu@magic-server:~$
```

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-system_engineering-devops`
- Directory: `0x0B-ssh`
- File: `2-ssh_config`

### 3. Let me in!

**File:** (No specific file)

Add the SSH public key provided in the task description to your server so that the Ubuntu user can connect.

```plaintext
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDNdtrNGtTXe5Tp1EJQop8mOSAuR

GLjJ6DW4PqX4wId/Kawz35ESampIqHSOTJmbQ8UlxdJuk0gAXKk3Ncle4safGYqM/VeDK3LN5iAJxf4kcaxNtS3eVxWBE5iF3FbIjOqwxw5Lf5sRa5yXxA8HfWidhbIG5TqKL922hPgsCGABIrXRlfZYeC0FEuPWdr6smOElSVvIXthRWp9cr685KdCI+COxlj1RdVsvIo+zunmLACF9PYdjB2s96Fn0ocD3c5SGLvDOFCyvDojSAOyE70ebIElnskKsDTGwfT4P6jh9OBzTyQEIS2jOaE5RQq4IB4DsMhvbjDSQrP0MdCLgwkN
```

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-system_engineering-devops`
- Directory: `0x0B-ssh`

### 4. Client configuration file (w/ Puppet)

**File:** `100-puppet_ssh_config.pp`

Use Puppet to make changes to your client SSH configuration file. Set it up so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.

**Requirements:**

- Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key `~/.ssh/school`
- Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse authentication using a password

Example:

```bash
vagrant@ubuntu:~$ sudo puppet apply 100-puppet_ssh_config.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for ubuntu-xenial in environment production in 0.11 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/File_line[Turn off passwd auth]/ensure: created
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/File_line[Declare identity file]/ensure: created
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.03 seconds
vagrant@ubuntu:~$
```

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `alx-system_engineering-devops`
- Directory: `0x0B-ssh`
- File: `100-puppet_ssh_config.pp`
