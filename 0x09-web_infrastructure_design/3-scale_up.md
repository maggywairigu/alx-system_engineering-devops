##Readme: Application Server vs. Web Server**

![3-scale_up](https://github.com/maggywairigu/alx-system_engineering-devops/assets/68754799/e8b3cbdd-0ad2-433e-bb96-20c962351ab5)

This document provides an overview of the design and distinctions between an application server and a web server within a web infrastructure. The setup includes a load balancer for distributing traffic, with separate servers for web, application, and database components.

## Infrastructure Overview

1. **Web Server:**
   - The web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) handles incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers.
   - It serves static files and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

2. **Application Server:**
   - The application server processes dynamic content requests, executing server-side code (e.g., PHP, Python).
   - It interacts with databases, performs calculations, and generates dynamic responses.

3. **Database Server:**
   - The database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) stores and retrieves data for the application.
   - It manages data integrity, supports read and write operations, and ensures data availability.

4. **Load Balancer (HAproxy Cluster):**
   - The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple web and application servers.
   - It ensures high availability, load distribution, and redundancy by operating in a cluster with another load balancer.

## Additional Elements and Their Purpose

- **Web Server:**
  The web server is responsible for efficiently serving static files (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) and handling initial user requests. It offloads tasks like SSL termination, compression, and caching.

- **Application Server:**
  The application server executes server-side code to process dynamic content, interact with databases, and generate responses. It ensures separation of concerns, scalability, and efficient resource utilization.

- **Database Server:**
  The database server stores and manages data for the application. It provides data integrity, concurrency control, and ACID compliance for reliable and consistent data operations.

- **Load Balancer (HAproxy Cluster):**
  The load balancer distributes incoming traffic to web and application servers, enhancing performance, availability, and scalability. Clustering ensures redundancy and fault tolerance.

## Design Considerations

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  Using separate servers for web, application, and database components ensures clear separation of responsibilities, improving maintainability and scalability.

- **Load Balancing:**
  Load balancing enhances user experience by distributing traffic evenly and preventing overload on individual servers.

- **High Availability:**
  The load balancer's cluster setup and separate servers contribute to high availability. If one server fails, traffic is redirected to healthy servers.

- **Scalability:**
  Separating components allows for vertical and horizontal scaling as needed. Additional web, application, and database servers can be added for increased capacity.

- **Resource Optimization:**
  By dedicating specific servers to each task, resources are optimized. Web servers handle web traffic, application servers process logic, and database servers manage data.
