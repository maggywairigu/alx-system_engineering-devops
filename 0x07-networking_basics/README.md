# 0x07. Networking Basics #0

## Project Description
This project is a part of the DevOps Network module and is designed to provide an introduction to Networking basics. It covers essential concepts such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, and network utilities like ping. The project aims to help participants understand the fundamental principles of computer networks and communication.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, participants are expected to be able to explain the following topics without relying on external resources:

1. OSI Model: What it is, how many layers it has, and how it is organized.
2. Local Area Network (LAN): Its typical usage and geographical size.
3. Wide Area Network (WAN): Its typical usage and geographical size.
4. The Internet: An overview of its functionality.
5. IP Address: What it is and the types of IP addresses (private and public).
6. IPv4 and IPv6: Basic understanding of the two IP versions.
7. Localhost: Definition and significance.
8. Subnet: What it is and its purpose.
9. Reasons behind the creation of IPv6.
10. TCP and UDP: The two primary data transfer protocols for IP and their main differences.
11. Ports: Definition and the ability to memorize common port numbers for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
12. ICMP: What is ping, and how it uses the Internet Control Message Protocol.

## Resources
Participants are encouraged to read or watch the following resources to reinforce their understanding of the topics covered in this project:

1. OSI model
2. Different types of networks (LAN, WAN, Internet)
3. MAC address
4. What is an IP address
5. Private and public IP address
6. IPv4 and IPv6
7. Localhost
8. TCP and UDP
9. TCP/UDP ports list
10. What is ping/ICMP
11. Positional parameters
12. Man or help for netstat and ping commands

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All Bash script files should be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Bash scripts must pass shellcheck without any error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does

## Tasks
The project consists of the following tasks:

1. OSI model: Answering multiple-choice questions about the OSI model and its organization.
2. Types of network: Identifying the type of network based on given scenarios.
3. MAC and IP address: Understanding MAC and IP addresses.
4. TCP and UDP: Answering questions about TCP and UDP protocols.
5. TCP and UDP ports: Writing a Bash script to display listening ports on a network device.
6. Is the host on the network: Writing a Bash script to ping an IP address.

## Copyright - Plagiarism
Participants are reminded that plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program. It is essential to come up with solutions for the tasks independently, meeting the learning objectives without copying someone else's work.
